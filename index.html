        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, it's so lovely to meet you! My name is Lin Cen, but you can call me Kalila. I was born in Venezuela, but my family's roots are firmly planted in Chinese culture. 
            Growing up, I had the privilege of spending my childhood in both Venezuela and China. However, when I was 11 years old, my family moved to Mexico, and it was there that 
            I truly felt at home. <br> Despite my Asian appearance, I grew up surrounded by Mexican culture, and I feel like my soul is that of a Mexican girl. I love to dance and sing, 
            but I'm not really a party person, which is perhaps a bit unusual for someone with my background. In fact, I'm quite the nerd and bookworm, so I think there's a bit of 
            Chinese in me too. <br> I think my love for travel might be in my genes. I've been lucky enough to explore many incredible places, including the United States, Canada, 
            Mexico, Venezuela, China, Japan, and France. Right now, I'm living life down under and soaking up the sun in Australia. <br> <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
            The reason I'm currently in Australia is because I've been working as an operations manager for IT projects for nearly five years now. Most of the projects I've worked on 
            have involved developing cool new apps or transforming companies through IT solutions. Working alongside project managers, product owners, and developers, I found myself 
            becoming increasingly interested in programming. So, I decided to make a big career change from business and management to becoming a programmer or developer. I've studied 
            a few related courses, but I felt like there was still so much to learn! That's why I decided to take the plunge and apply for the Master of Computing and Innovations program 
            at the University of Adelaide in Australia. <br> Time sure does fly, and I can hardly believe that I'm already in my final year of my master's degree. Looking back, it's been 
            an amazing journey so far! I've learned so many new things, met incredible people, and discovered the vibrant Australian culture. Being a full-time student again has been such 
            a treat, allowing me to soak up all the university life has to offer. But most importantly, I've made some lifelong friends who share my passions for studying, learning, and 
            pursuing our dreams. It's truly inspiring to be surrounded by such motivated and driven individuals who are all working towards something bigger than themselves. <br> I'm 
            currently juggling both university courses and bootcamp courses, and let me tell you, it's been a wild ride. But even though I'm as busy as a bee, I'm absolutely loving this 
            sense of productivity! I can't wait to put all my hard work to the test and land my first internship next semester. It's the next big step in my journey, and I'm excited to 
            see where it takes me. Sure, things may be a little crazy right now, but it's all worth it to chase after my dreams!<br>
